It will load the referenced JavaScript file and reload it if any changes are detected. If the path is relative, it is resolved relatively to the absolute location of the primary configuration file. If this file is a symlink, it will be resolved before resolving the location of the required file. If the file does not exist, require will throw an error.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"api/screen":{"id":"api/screen","title":"Screen","description":"Use Screen to access frame sizes and other screens on a multi-screen setup.

These features are only supported on El Capitan (10.11) and upwards. A single window can be in multiple spaces at the same time. To move a window to a different space, remove it from any existing spaces and add it to a new one. In 3.0.0+, you can use the moveWindows(...) function.

A timer can fire only once or be repeating.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"api/window":{"id":"api/window","title":"Window","description":"Use Window to control app windows. Every screen (i.e. display) combines to form a large rectangle. Every window lives within this rectangle and their position can be altered by giving coordinates inside this rectangle. To position a window to a specific display, you need to calculate its position within the large rectangle. To figure out the coordinates for a given screen, use the functions in Screen. Beware that a window can get stale if you keep a reference to it and it is for instance closed while you do so.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"getting-started/about-coordinates":{"id":"getting-started/about-coordinates","title":"About Coordinates","description":"macOS has two commonly used coordinate systems: for higher level elements the origo (0, 0) is situated in the bottom left corner of the screen, on the contrary for lower level elements the origo is situated in the top left corner of the screen (flipped).","sidebar":"sidebar"},"getting-started/introduction":{"id":"getting-started/introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"Many of the API classes represent global objects in the script\u2019s context \u2014 methods that are marked as static can be accessed through these global objects. All other functions are instance methods. Instance objects can be accessed through the global objects or constructed with the relevant constructors.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"getting-started/loading":{"id":"getting-started/loading","title":"Loading","description":"Your configuration file is loaded when the app launches. All functions are evaluated (and executed if necessary) when this happens. Phoenix also reloads the configuration when any changes are detected to the file(s). You may also reload the configuration manually from the status bar or programmatically from your script.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"getting-started/logging-and-debugging":{"id":"getting-started/logging-and-debugging","title":"Logging and Debugging","description":"To log messages, use Phoenix.log. The messages are delivered to the Console (app). You can filter logs by process by searching for \u201cPhoenix\u201d. You can also follow the logs from a terminal by running log stream --process Phoenix.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"getting-started/managing-handlers":{"id":"getting-started/managing-handlers","title":"Managing Handlers","description":"As previously mentioned you must keep a reference to your handlers, otherwise your callbacks will not get called. In return, if you release the reference to the handler, it will also be disabled eventually. Beware that this can be rather delayed and you are always safer to manually disable the handlers before letting the reference go. This gives you full control over the lifecycle of your handlers and can be especially useful when you want to dynamically create handlers.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"getting-started/preprocessing":{"id":"getting-started/preprocessing","title":"Preprocessing","description":"You may add JavaScript preprocessing to your configuration by adding a Shebang)-directive to the beginning of your file. It must be the first statement in your file. Phoenix should support all popular JavaScript compilers, but be aware that you need to have the compiler installed on your setup and accessible through your shell\u2019s PATH for Phoenix to find it. You also need to ask the compiler to output to the standard output so Phoenix is able to evaluate the result.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"getting-started/typescript":{"id":"getting-started/typescript","title":"TypeScript","description":"You can obviously build the Phoenix configuration using TypeScript. Use the phoenix-typings library for the API type definitions. Thanks @mafredri! \ud83d\ude4c","sidebar":"sidebar"},"index":{"id":"index","title":"Phoenix","description":"A lightweight macOS window and app manager scriptable with JavaScript. You can also easily use languages which compile to JavaScript such as TypeScript. Phoenix aims for efficiency and a very small footprint. If you like the idea of scripting your own window or app management toolkit with JavaScript, Phoenix is probably going to give you the things you want. With Phoenix you can bind keyboard shortcuts and system events, and use these to interact with macOS.","sidebar":"sidebar"}}}}')}}]);
